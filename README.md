## Description

This site takes an input as a prompt and then offers three choices. You can click on each of the three sentences. 

1. The first shows your original sentence.
2. The second takes the first and last letter, capitalizes them, and then adds to the end of your sentence, it also divides the number of characters in your sentence by two, rounds down and then adds the character at the resulting number position to the front of the sentence.
3. The third reverses the result in the second.
